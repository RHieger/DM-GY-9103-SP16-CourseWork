 * The ImageStore() class stores images taken by the      *
 * user of Homepwner, allows those to be read into        *
 * memory for display on the UIImageView, and provides    *
 * a cache that gives quick access to these images, but   *
 * flushes the memory of the references to these images   *
 * when a low memory warning is received. This prevents   *
 * the application from crashing due to running out of    *
 * available memory.                                      *
 *                                                        *
